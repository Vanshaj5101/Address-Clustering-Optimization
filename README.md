# Address Clustering Optimization

## Project Overview
The project addresses the challenge of optimizing address clustering in densely populated areas like India, where non-standardized and incomplete address data complicate efficient delivery and logistical operations. Using advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, our aim is to systematically organize addresses into cohesive clusters based on proximity, enhancing delivery route optimization, reducing transit times, and improving address verification processes.

## Dataset
The data, collected from a GitHub repository hosted by the Machine Learning Research Group at Universit√© Laval (GRAAL/GRAIL), consists of addresses that have been cleaned and structured for analysis. This dataset includes addresses with multilingual entries, which were standardized using the GoogleTrans API for accurate clustering.

## Methods and Algorithms
We employ a variety of state-of-the-art clustering algorithms including:
- K-Means clustering
- DBSCAN
- Self-organizing maps (SOMs)
- Hierarchical clustering
- Neural networks, including CNNs, RNNs (LSTM), and Transformer models (BERT)

## Project Structure
